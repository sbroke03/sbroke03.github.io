        <div class="text-box" data-bg="images/image1.jpg">An older gentleman by the name of Harold walked through the pitch black night, knowing he was in a city, but nothing more.</div>
        <div class="text-box" data-bg="images/image2.jpg">He spotted a light peering through a window. He could make out a train station of some sort.</div>
        <div class="text-box" data-bg="images/image3.jpg">Harold walked into the station and saw a waiting room. <br><br><br> He was excited to find sanctuary from the darkness, so much that he didn't even question his strangely outdated surroundings.</div>
        <div class="text-box" data-bg="images/image4.jpg">Looking around more, getting a feel for the place, he saw a kitchenette in the corner, as well as a station clerks desk.</div>
        <div class="text-box" data-bg="images/image5.jpg">Harold walked toward the station clerk's desk, approaching the man. <br><br><br> Silently, he handed him a thick ticket, blank on both sides.</div>
        <div class="text-box" data-bg="images/image6.jpg">The stewardess who was standing in the kitchenette walked up and offered Harold a cup of tea, the way it should be served: in a small, round cup with a saucer.</div>
        <div class="text-box" data-bg="images/image7.jpg">Harold was astonishingly confused at this point. <br><br> Giving the waiting room a closer look, he observed a woman with her baby who he did not recognize, as well as a blonde man, ornamented with leather clothing who he also did not recognize. <br><br><br> Lastly, he saw a wounded soldier sitting in one of the waiting chairs.</div>
        <div class="text-box" data-bg="images/image8.jpg">Harold approached the soldier and recounted his time in the war to the soldier. <br><br> Getting offended by  Harold discussing serving, the soldier accused him of stolen valor due to his age. Again confused, Harold saw his reflection in the window and saw his youthful complexion. Astonished, Harold told of the time the love of his life, Margie, was killed in the war by a stray bombshell hitting her cafe. <br><br><br>This brought back many memories for Harold, forcing him to withdraw from the conversation and take a minute away from people.</div>
        <div class="text-box" data-bg="images/image9.jpg">At this point, the blonde man dressed in biker attire, approached Harold. He asked him about his time in the war.</div>
        <div class="text-box" data-bg="images/image10.jpg">Harold recounted his time in the air force. Talking about his bomber and his targets, the blonde man interrupted, <br><br><br> "Do you remember the house you hit in Berlin? The civilian house that held a mother and a father and their small child?" <br><br> Harold looked at him with tears still in his eyes, and nodded his head. The blonde man explained that his parents were killed by an American bomber in the city of Berlin.<br> "It was just war. It was my job," Harold told the man. <br><br>"Would you accept that same response from the man who killed your Margie?" <br>Harold thought for a moment, looked up at the man, and nodded.</div>
        <div class="text-box" data-bg="images/image11.jpg">Behind Harold, he felt a hand on his back. He turned around and saw the woman with his child, who he recognized immediately. <br><br> "Margie!" Harold shouted. <br><br>"You didn't know I was pregnant. I never told you." Margie told him. <br><br> Harold was confused and asked her about the train, the station, and how she's alive. <br><br>Margie explained that the blonde man was a test, whether or not he was able to take the train to eternity. Harold looked at Margie and asked if he had passed. She nodded yes.</div>
        <div class="text-box" data-bg="images/image12.jpg">"All aboard" the conductor yelled. Margie and Harold, hand in hand, walked toward the train, eagerly waiting for eternity.</div>
